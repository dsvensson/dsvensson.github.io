Maybe it would have been better if it were two thirds of its size, or maybe even half the size. But the last 100-200 pages were amazing so maybe it can’t be cut down. I’m not that widely travelled in religions to understand the controversy of this book, but it makes a great story.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Frank Herbert - Dune</a></p>\n<p>We’ve all seen the movie, played the games, had the daydreams about <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Atreides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Paul Muad’Dib</a></em>, and perhaps even seen the mini-series, but at least I had unfortunately missed reading the book. This one was a real page turner and it’s probably a book I can read again if I ever get the time. An epic tale well worth reading, really really good.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Terry Pratchett - Mort</a></p>\n<p>Not much to say. If you like Discworld, you’ll probably like this one too. I think I’m beginning to lose interest in this realm, but it was an okisch book with quite some laughter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enders_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Orson Scott Card - Enders Game</a></p>\n<p>I was told by Anders and Daniel, who I studied with some years back, that this book was teh shit, now after reading it I can do nothing but agree. Real page turner this one too. An amazing story about the kid Ender going through tough training to save the Earth from the evil buggers. Very well written, you really feel for Ender as the plot unravels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Arthur C. Clarke - Rendezvous with Rama</a></p>\n<p>This is the first Clarke book I’ve read, never even watched the movie 2001. The book has a very scientific feel to it and is very well written, after some pages you are suddenly a part of the group planning to, and finally exploring the landscapes of Rama, a master piece.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Noon#Pixel_Juice_(1998)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jeff Noon - Pixel Juice</a></p>\n<p>A collection of psychedelic mind-bending short stories about the life in the alternate Noon-reality of Manchester. I’ve read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphomation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nymphomation</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vurt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vurt</a> previously to this one so some stories feel familiar but I really like the way Noon formulates his sentences. The experience of reading the words together brings something on its own on top of the story, like listening to music, but instead of enjoying the tune, you enjoy the combination of the words, very strange. Anyway, Pixel Juice rocked, lots of the stories which I would like to see a full book of, and maybe in the future that might happen. Strongly recommend it if you like Jeff Noon, but if you haven’t read Noon yet, then maybe some of his other books might be a better starting point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_dead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Orson Scott Card - Speaker for the Dead</a></p>\n<p>This is the sequel of Ender’s Game, and was recommended by the same persons, and this one was also good. Not really as good as the first in the series, but well worth reading. Card is a great writer but it feels like he in this book tries to tie together too many diffrent strings and is not as thorough as in Ender’s Game. But overall a great story.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the books are between 4 and 5 out of 5 so I can recommend them all (except perhaps Mort). I’m currently racing through another of Arthur C. Clarke’s books, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_of_paradise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Fountains of Paradise</a>, where an engineer is on his way of building a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">space elevator</a>, pretty good too, not as good as Rendezvous with Rama yet, but it has a nice touch in its own way.</p>","fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-07-04-sci-fi-junkie-fix-tips","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Looking for a sci-fi fix?","date":"04 Jul '07"}},"headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='27'%3e%3cpath d='M2 1L1 13l-1 6c0 4 0 4 3 4 2 0 2 0 1 1H1l-1 1c0 2 3 2 15 2h14v-5c0-5-1-6-3-4v3c0 1-2 2-5 2l-4 1-2 1-2-1c0-2 6-4 9-4 3 1 3-1-1-2-3 0-1-2 4-2 3 0 4-1 4-3l-1-3H16C5 10 5 10 5 3c0-3-2-4-3-2m32 13v13h9c7 0 9 0 9-2 0 0-1-2-3-2-3-1-3-1-2-8V9h-3l-4 1V5c0-5 0-5-3-5h-2l-1 14m20-2v11h4c3 0 4 0 5 2 0 2 1 2 14 2 16 0 15 1 15-11 0-8 1-12 3-12l1 10c0 6 0 9 1 8 1-2 1-2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 1l2 1 1 2V4c0-3-1-4-6-4-6 0-6 0-5 2 0 4-8 7-20 7h-9V0h-9v12m57-5c-1 8 0 14 4 17v1l-2 1 14 1 14-1h2l10 1c11 0 11 1 11-22V0l-2 3-2 4c1 1 0 1-3 1l-7 1-5-1c-3-3-2-5 1-5l3-1h-3l-3-1-2-1-1 1c1 0-1 3-3 3l-3-2c-3-2-4-2-9-2h-11c-3 0-3 0-3 7m68-4c0 3 0 3 2 1 0-1 2-2 3-1 1 0 1 1-1 3-2 1-2 2-1 2v1l-1 3c0 1-1 2-2 1v6c0 1 1 2 5 2 7 2 8 2 2 2l-6 1h2l3 1c0 1 2 2 10 2 9 0 10 0 10-2 0-1 1-2 3-2h3V0h-33l1 3m36-2c-2 2 0 26 1 26v-1c0-2 1-2 3 0l9 1h8l-2-3-1-2c1-1-6-14-7-13-2 1-5-1-5-5-1-3-1-3-2-1l-1 3V3c0-2-2-4-3-2m99 0c-1 2 3 8 5 9v3l-1-1-2-1 1 2v2c-2 1-2 1-2-1s0-2-1-1h-2l-1 2 1 2 1-1h1l-1 2-1 3-2-3c-2-2-7-2-5 0h2l1 1-3 1c-2 0-2 0-2 2l1 3c0 2 1 2 48 2h48V15c0-10 0-11-2-11-1 0-2 0-2-2 0-3-9-3-11 0v2h-1l-1 1c-1 1-1 0-1-2 1-4-1-4-2 0 0 2-1 2-1 1V2c0-2 0-2-1-1l-2 1c1 4-1 6-4 5-4 0-6-2-3-2 2 0 2 0 1-1-2 0-2-1-1-2l2 1c0 2 1 1 3-1 1-2 0-2-3-2l-7 2c-2 1-2 2-1 2h2l-2 1-2 2 2 1c2-1 4 0 4 2l-5 1-6 1h-1l2-2 1-2-2-4V0h-9c-9 0-10 0-10 2l-1 3V2c0-2-1-2-3-2l-3 1h-2c-2-1-7-1-7 1l1 1v1c0 2-2 0-2-2s-5-3-6-1m-44 7l-1 1c-1-1-1 1-1 3 0 4 0 4-1 1 0-3-1-3-5-4l-6-1c-1 0-1 4 1 10l2 6c1 3 1 3 11 3 7 0 9 0 9-2v-3l-2-2-2-5-3-5c-1-4-2-5-2-2' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":14.867924528301886,"src":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/accda/wastelands-header.jpg 200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/fc61b/wastelands-header.jpg 400w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg 800w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/34bdc/wastelands-header.jpg 1200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/bdccb/wastelands-header.jpg 1600w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/0ffcb/wastelands-header.jpg 3940w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"indexImage":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/2007-07-04-sci-fi-junkie-fix-tips","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-05-24-microsoft-windows-must-die"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Microsoft Windows must die"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-10-22-unfinished-gui-crap"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unfinished GUI crap"}}}}}
