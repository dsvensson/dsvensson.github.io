About two years later the laptop started acting weird. It shut down even though there was still a lot of charge left in the battery and other strange symptoms. A call to Apple and a quick battery check in the store and she got a new battery thanks to the battery exchange program they had running back then, almost no questions asked, and all was well again.</p>\n<p>A while ago the battery started acting up again. We came home from a short vacation and the battery icon had a cross over it and the battery didn’t charge. I got on the phone with Apple and they of course answered that I was SOL, but after refusing to accept that they told me to go to an Apple Support store to test if the battery was depleted, or defect. Needless to say it was defect, it had gone from acceptable performance to no performance in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>Ok, so with the blessing of an Apple technician I called Apple again and now things started to get strange. The support now told me batteries were something you used up and that this battery too was used up even though the technician said otherwise. After a while I had the support guy accept that Apple didn’t manufacture their batteries to suddenly die after a years usage, but rather become less and less able to hold the charge. Based on this acceptance I tried pointing out that Konsumentköplagen (law to protect consumers here in Sweden) protected me from manufacturing errors, and as we both agreed that the battery was incorrectly manufactured, as determined by their party, this would give me the right, and according to me, right to a new battery.</p>\n<p>This convincing had taken a while and the support guy was definitely not interested in Konsumentköplagen nor talking with me, so he redirected me up one level after he had explained the case to the next guy.</p>\n<p>The next guy had been told by his managers that batteries were something you used up, and thus the Konsumentköplagen didn’t apply, but when asking for a legal reference to his statement that batteries was specifically not covered by the Konsumentköplagen he got a bit defensive, specially after me pointing out that the first hit on Google has the title “Apple doesn’t care about Konsumentköpslagen”. After a short battle he sent me one step up to something he explained to be their office for more law-related questions.</p>\n<p>This time a Danish girl answered and the conversation continued in english and she didn’t seem to have ever heard of the Konsumentköplagen, but was kind enough to give me a 30% discount code on a new battery from Apple Store. I accepted this as the alternative according to her was to talk to their lawyers, and that seemed like a too big effort considering the price of a new battery.</p>\n<p>I’m still not completely sure who was right in this case, they never explicitly said that I was wrong. The Konsumentköplagen says that’s it up to the consumer to prove the manufacturing error, but as their technician had determined this already I believe that I was right, and I have still not found any explanation to the relation between Konsumentköplagen and batteries.</p>","fields":{"slug":"posts/2009-06-24-batteries-and-apple","readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Batteries and Apple","date":"24 Jun '09"}},"headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='27'%3e%3cpath d='M2 1L1 13l-1 6c0 4 0 4 3 4 2 0 2 0 1 1H1l-1 1c0 2 3 2 15 2h14v-5c0-5-1-6-3-4v3c0 1-2 2-5 2l-4 1-2 1-2-1c0-2 6-4 9-4 3 1 3-1-1-2-3 0-1-2 4-2 3 0 4-1 4-3l-1-3H16C5 10 5 10 5 3c0-3-2-4-3-2m32 13v13h9c7 0 9 0 9-2 0 0-1-2-3-2-3-1-3-1-2-8V9h-3l-4 1V5c0-5 0-5-3-5h-2l-1 14m20-2v11h4c3 0 4 0 5 2 0 2 1 2 14 2 16 0 15 1 15-11 0-8 1-12 3-12l1 10c0 6 0 9 1 8 1-2 1-2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 1l2 1 1 2V4c0-3-1-4-6-4-6 0-6 0-5 2 0 4-8 7-20 7h-9V0h-9v12m57-5c-1 8 0 14 4 17v1l-2 1 14 1 14-1h2l10 1c11 0 11 1 11-22V0l-2 3-2 4c1 1 0 1-3 1l-7 1-5-1c-3-3-2-5 1-5l3-1h-3l-3-1-2-1-1 1c1 0-1 3-3 3l-3-2c-3-2-4-2-9-2h-11c-3 0-3 0-3 7m68-4c0 3 0 3 2 1 0-1 2-2 3-1 1 0 1 1-1 3-2 1-2 2-1 2v1l-1 3c0 1-1 2-2 1v6c0 1 1 2 5 2 7 2 8 2 2 2l-6 1h2l3 1c0 1 2 2 10 2 9 0 10 0 10-2 0-1 1-2 3-2h3V0h-33l1 3m36-2c-2 2 0 26 1 26v-1c0-2 1-2 3 0l9 1h8l-2-3-1-2c1-1-6-14-7-13-2 1-5-1-5-5-1-3-1-3-2-1l-1 3V3c0-2-2-4-3-2m99 0c-1 2 3 8 5 9v3l-1-1-2-1 1 2v2c-2 1-2 1-2-1s0-2-1-1h-2l-1 2 1 2 1-1h1l-1 2-1 3-2-3c-2-2-7-2-5 0h2l1 1-3 1c-2 0-2 0-2 2l1 3c0 2 1 2 48 2h48V15c0-10 0-11-2-11-1 0-2 0-2-2 0-3-9-3-11 0v2h-1l-1 1c-1 1-1 0-1-2 1-4-1-4-2 0 0 2-1 2-1 1V2c0-2 0-2-1-1l-2 1c1 4-1 6-4 5-4 0-6-2-3-2 2 0 2 0 1-1-2 0-2-1-1-2l2 1c0 2 1 1 3-1 1-2 0-2-3-2l-7 2c-2 1-2 2-1 2h2l-2 1-2 2 2 1c2-1 4 0 4 2l-5 1-6 1h-1l2-2 1-2-2-4V0h-9c-9 0-10 0-10 2l-1 3V2c0-2-1-2-3-2l-3 1h-2c-2-1-7-1-7 1l1 1v1c0 2-2 0-2-2s-5-3-6-1m-44 7l-1 1c-1-1-1 1-1 3 0 4 0 4-1 1 0-3-1-3-5-4l-6-1c-1 0-1 4 1 10l2 6c1 3 1 3 11 3 7 0 9 0 9-2v-3l-2-2-2-5-3-5c-1-4-2-5-2-2' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":14.867924528301886,"src":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/accda/wastelands-header.jpg 200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/fc61b/wastelands-header.jpg 400w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg 800w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/34bdc/wastelands-header.jpg 1200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/bdccb/wastelands-header.jpg 1600w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/0ffcb/wastelands-header.jpg 3940w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"indexImage":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/2009-06-24-batteries-and-apple","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2009-02-11-android-lastfm-best-thing-since-sliced-bread"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Android + Last.fm = best thing since sliced bread!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2010-03-15-androidified"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Androidified"}}}}}
