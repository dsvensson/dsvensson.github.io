Too noisy to speak so when\nreaching the target altitude of about 1500 meters the jump leader pointed at person\nafter person to jump. Before I knew it, the finger was pointing straight in my face.</p>\n<p>With a cord connecting the sprint of the parachute to the airplane I found myself\nstanding at the edge of the hatch, holding the handles, wind blowing hard in my face,\nlooking down at the ground where I’d been standing just moments ago. It felt surreal\nto say the least.</p>\n<p>Cliché thoughts like <em>“This is not normal, what the hell am I doing?”</em> passed through\nmy head, countered by reasoning that the test leader wouldn’t allow me to be in this\nposition if there was a high probability that I would die.</p>\n<p><em>As I felt a clap on my back, I took the leap.</em></p>\n<p>It’s a very non-intuitive thing to do. A couple of million years ago our ancestors\nclimbed down the trees, and the vast majority of us have remained fairly close to\nground ever since. The most rational reason to leave an airplane in this manner would\nbe if it was going to crash, explode or some other horrible outcome. Yet here I was,\nleaning 45 degrees out of a perfectly functioning airplane, hands in the middle of the\nair - grasping the nothingness, feet barely touching the closest thing to safety for\njust a fraction of a second longer.</p>\n<p>What happened next is both easy and hard to explain.  The sprint of the backpack was\nattached to the airplane via a short cord. The length of the cords connecting the harness\nto the parachute cloth is about 10 meters, which, given gravity and the length of the\nauto-deploy cord, results in a bit over a second long free fall, and then over to gliding\nunder the parachute.</p>\n<p>My recollection is a bit more nuanced. Once my feet had lost contact with the airplane\nmy perception of sensory input radically changed. It felt as if reality grabbed hold\nof my face, violently forcing itself into my experience at an extreme pace. My field\nof vision felt widened as I looked out onto the horizon and the Scanian landscape.\nFrom the depths of my throat, an abysmal scream of terrified excitement rushed out -\nyet I recall an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_exclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">absolute silence</a>. I wouldn’t say time stood still as that would\nexclude the passage of events, but it was without doubt <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachypsychia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">largest time dilation</a> I\nhad ever perceived. Just as quickly as I had entered this frame of mind, just as quickly\nI was jolted right back out of it, finding myself hanging safely under the parachute,\nslowly swinging from one side to the other.</p>\n<p>The glide down was probably impressive as well, but for me it got somewhat lost\nin the shadows of what I had just experienced and it’s not something that I look\nback to with the same warm feelings as the initial leap. I managed to navigate to\nthe correct landing spot, but it proved difficult to get the forward movement down\nto a reasonable speed and at the same time matching the downward movement towards\nthe ground. It was a rough landig, but I did so without injury and could enjoy\nwhat was left from the afterglow of this extreme experience before the last of it\nhad faded.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/590ba/parachute.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 650px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHSJmGrCQi//8QAHBAAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQTFDEy/9oACAEBAAEFAst46olaX5BNz8H/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhD/2gAIAQMBAT8BmRlc/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQIBAT8Bqv/EABsQAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAiAhMTKR/9oACAEBAAY/AsIvLhu6P//EAB0QAAAFBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEhMUFxgbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hdgnRMO8Are5ElGE//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBU3//EABkRAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETGh8f/aAAgBAwEBPxB4Mq66U//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBNSj//xAAdEAEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMWGxQYGR/9oACAEBAAE/EKNMsDTv7M2w4QBFLR8YL1HRrnqEVFAL3DAHE//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Parachuting\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/a111b/parachute.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/aca85/parachute.jpg 163w,\n/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/0954f/parachute.jpg 325w,\n/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/a111b/parachute.jpg 650w,\n/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/ce471/parachute.jpg 975w,\n/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/bee4e/parachute.jpg 1300w,\n/static/c6346cd9f92c3716674a9d290a3c41cd/590ba/parachute.jpg 2592w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>There’s nothing quite like it. Rollercoasters don’t stand a chance. Personally\nI have no wish to try it again - the risk of injury during landing seem a bit too\nplausible. If it was just the jumping out the airplane over and over again I’d be\nfirst in line. Based on this, I think my next experience in this category will be\na bungee jump, or perhaps a tandem parachute jump which would increase the free\nfall to 45 seconds.</p>","fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-04-28-parachute","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Parachuting!","date":"28 Apr '07"}},"headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='27'%3e%3cpath d='M2 1L1 13l-1 6c0 4 0 4 3 4 2 0 2 0 1 1H1l-1 1c0 2 3 2 15 2h14v-5c0-5-1-6-3-4v3c0 1-2 2-5 2l-4 1-2 1-2-1c0-2 6-4 9-4 3 1 3-1-1-2-3 0-1-2 4-2 3 0 4-1 4-3l-1-3H16C5 10 5 10 5 3c0-3-2-4-3-2m32 13v13h9c7 0 9 0 9-2 0 0-1-2-3-2-3-1-3-1-2-8V9h-3l-4 1V5c0-5 0-5-3-5h-2l-1 14m20-2v11h4c3 0 4 0 5 2 0 2 1 2 14 2 16 0 15 1 15-11 0-8 1-12 3-12l1 10c0 6 0 9 1 8 1-2 1-2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 1l2 1 1 2V4c0-3-1-4-6-4-6 0-6 0-5 2 0 4-8 7-20 7h-9V0h-9v12m57-5c-1 8 0 14 4 17v1l-2 1 14 1 14-1h2l10 1c11 0 11 1 11-22V0l-2 3-2 4c1 1 0 1-3 1l-7 1-5-1c-3-3-2-5 1-5l3-1h-3l-3-1-2-1-1 1c1 0-1 3-3 3l-3-2c-3-2-4-2-9-2h-11c-3 0-3 0-3 7m68-4c0 3 0 3 2 1 0-1 2-2 3-1 1 0 1 1-1 3-2 1-2 2-1 2v1l-1 3c0 1-1 2-2 1v6c0 1 1 2 5 2 7 2 8 2 2 2l-6 1h2l3 1c0 1 2 2 10 2 9 0 10 0 10-2 0-1 1-2 3-2h3V0h-33l1 3m36-2c-2 2 0 26 1 26v-1c0-2 1-2 3 0l9 1h8l-2-3-1-2c1-1-6-14-7-13-2 1-5-1-5-5-1-3-1-3-2-1l-1 3V3c0-2-2-4-3-2m99 0c-1 2 3 8 5 9v3l-1-1-2-1 1 2v2c-2 1-2 1-2-1s0-2-1-1h-2l-1 2 1 2 1-1h1l-1 2-1 3-2-3c-2-2-7-2-5 0h2l1 1-3 1c-2 0-2 0-2 2l1 3c0 2 1 2 48 2h48V15c0-10 0-11-2-11-1 0-2 0-2-2 0-3-9-3-11 0v2h-1l-1 1c-1 1-1 0-1-2 1-4-1-4-2 0 0 2-1 2-1 1V2c0-2 0-2-1-1l-2 1c1 4-1 6-4 5-4 0-6-2-3-2 2 0 2 0 1-1-2 0-2-1-1-2l2 1c0 2 1 1 3-1 1-2 0-2-3-2l-7 2c-2 1-2 2-1 2h2l-2 1-2 2 2 1c2-1 4 0 4 2l-5 1-6 1h-1l2-2 1-2-2-4V0h-9c-9 0-10 0-10 2l-1 3V2c0-2-1-2-3-2l-3 1h-2c-2-1-7-1-7 1l1 1v1c0 2-2 0-2-2s-5-3-6-1m-44 7l-1 1c-1-1-1 1-1 3 0 4 0 4-1 1 0-3-1-3-5-4l-6-1c-1 0-1 4 1 10l2 6c1 3 1 3 11 3 7 0 9 0 9-2v-3l-2-2-2-5-3-5c-1-4-2-5-2-2' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":14.867924528301886,"src":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/accda/wastelands-header.jpg 200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/fc61b/wastelands-header.jpg 400w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg 800w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/34bdc/wastelands-header.jpg 1200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/bdccb/wastelands-header.jpg 1600w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/0ffcb/wastelands-header.jpg 3940w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"indexImage":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/2007-04-28-parachute","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-04-10-i-hate-the-smell-of-newspapers-in-the-morning"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I hate the smell of newspapers in the morning"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2007-05-24-microsoft-windows-must-die"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Microsoft Windows must die"}}}}}
