Apparently the janitor assigned to replace the bathroom window thought it was a good idea to drop in unannounced at 7.30 am. I’d got at least 6 hours of sleep so after a cup of coffee the day started.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes of work the builder decided he couldn’t finish the work at place so he brought the window with him. An hour later he came back and put the window in place, followed by loud complaints about the bad shape the previous builders had left the windows in.</p>\n<p>Yey! After 2 months of transparent windows next to the toilet it was finally back to normal, or so I thought. When I opened the window I noticed that he hadn’t actually fixed the glass to the window frame, but left it kind of hanging there, and closing it again proved impossible without a huge amount of violence.</p>\n<p>Re-dialed the number and a while later two other janitors came by to clean up the mess of the first one. They stayed the whole afternoon fixing both the window and some other stuff that had been waiting to get fixed for quite some time. When leaving they concluded that they had to come back the next day to finish things up. So out they went, leaving all the garbage where it had landed. Some primal instinct tells me they will not show up tomorrow.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>:\nIt’s been about 2.5 weeks now and they still haven’t come back. They also tore a 1.5m branch off my hops plant, that was the longest branch by the time, bastards!</p>","fields":{"slug":"posts/2006-06-14-oh-brave-new-world","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oh, Brave New World","date":"14 Jun '06"}},"headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='27'%3e%3cpath d='M2 1L1 13l-1 6c0 4 0 4 3 4 2 0 2 0 1 1H1l-1 1c0 2 3 2 15 2h14v-5c0-5-1-6-3-4v3c0 1-2 2-5 2l-4 1-2 1-2-1c0-2 6-4 9-4 3 1 3-1-1-2-3 0-1-2 4-2 3 0 4-1 4-3l-1-3H16C5 10 5 10 5 3c0-3-2-4-3-2m32 13v13h9c7 0 9 0 9-2 0 0-1-2-3-2-3-1-3-1-2-8V9h-3l-4 1V5c0-5 0-5-3-5h-2l-1 14m20-2v11h4c3 0 4 0 5 2 0 2 1 2 14 2 16 0 15 1 15-11 0-8 1-12 3-12l1 10c0 6 0 9 1 8 1-2 1-2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 1l2 1 1 2V4c0-3-1-4-6-4-6 0-6 0-5 2 0 4-8 7-20 7h-9V0h-9v12m57-5c-1 8 0 14 4 17v1l-2 1 14 1 14-1h2l10 1c11 0 11 1 11-22V0l-2 3-2 4c1 1 0 1-3 1l-7 1-5-1c-3-3-2-5 1-5l3-1h-3l-3-1-2-1-1 1c1 0-1 3-3 3l-3-2c-3-2-4-2-9-2h-11c-3 0-3 0-3 7m68-4c0 3 0 3 2 1 0-1 2-2 3-1 1 0 1 1-1 3-2 1-2 2-1 2v1l-1 3c0 1-1 2-2 1v6c0 1 1 2 5 2 7 2 8 2 2 2l-6 1h2l3 1c0 1 2 2 10 2 9 0 10 0 10-2 0-1 1-2 3-2h3V0h-33l1 3m36-2c-2 2 0 26 1 26v-1c0-2 1-2 3 0l9 1h8l-2-3-1-2c1-1-6-14-7-13-2 1-5-1-5-5-1-3-1-3-2-1l-1 3V3c0-2-2-4-3-2m99 0c-1 2 3 8 5 9v3l-1-1-2-1 1 2v2c-2 1-2 1-2-1s0-2-1-1h-2l-1 2 1 2 1-1h1l-1 2-1 3-2-3c-2-2-7-2-5 0h2l1 1-3 1c-2 0-2 0-2 2l1 3c0 2 1 2 48 2h48V15c0-10 0-11-2-11-1 0-2 0-2-2 0-3-9-3-11 0v2h-1l-1 1c-1 1-1 0-1-2 1-4-1-4-2 0 0 2-1 2-1 1V2c0-2 0-2-1-1l-2 1c1 4-1 6-4 5-4 0-6-2-3-2 2 0 2 0 1-1-2 0-2-1-1-2l2 1c0 2 1 1 3-1 1-2 0-2-3-2l-7 2c-2 1-2 2-1 2h2l-2 1-2 2 2 1c2-1 4 0 4 2l-5 1-6 1h-1l2-2 1-2-2-4V0h-9c-9 0-10 0-10 2l-1 3V2c0-2-1-2-3-2l-3 1h-2c-2-1-7-1-7 1l1 1v1c0 2-2 0-2-2s-5-3-6-1m-44 7l-1 1c-1-1-1 1-1 3 0 4 0 4-1 1 0-3-1-3-5-4l-6-1c-1 0-1 4 1 10l2 6c1 3 1 3 11 3 7 0 9 0 9-2v-3l-2-2-2-5-3-5c-1-4-2-5-2-2' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":14.867924528301886,"src":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/accda/wastelands-header.jpg 200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/fc61b/wastelands-header.jpg 400w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/1bdc6/wastelands-header.jpg 800w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/34bdc/wastelands-header.jpg 1200w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/bdccb/wastelands-header.jpg 1600w,\n/static/843c5f7defd25c41f8cae57182fd6f1f/0ffcb/wastelands-header.jpg 3940w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"indexImage":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/2006-06-14-oh-brave-new-world","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2006-06-01-injustice"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Injustice"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"posts/2006-07-02-a-first-glance-at-j2me"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A first glance at J2ME"}}}}}
