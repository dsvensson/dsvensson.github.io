This morning I picked up my new [Sony Ericsson K750i][1] ([WP][2]) phone after several weeks of waiting. The service from [Comviq][3] ([WP][4]) was a bit shaky and just a week ago I was about to discontinue the order and pick another company, but after some compensations I decided to wait instead.

The problems began when I first ordered the phone, or when I thought I ordered the phone. Something messed up the moving of my old number to the new service provider and the order was quietly put on hold by some [evil computer][5] without letting anyone know.

After two weeks I called Comviq and asked what was going on since I hadn't heard anything from them since my original call. The support replied that they would contact me when they knew what was going on, and five minutes later I got an SMS telling me that my number was to be moved to Comviq the week after. Knowing that the order should have taken a total of 3 weeks I called them and asked what was going on, and this time I was told about the problems with the original order and that it would take about 2 additional weeks for the phone to arrive since they couldn't send it before my number was all done.

Two weeks went, I got my SIM card and the paperworks but still no phone. The 18:th of July my [previous provider][6] revoked my SIM-card and now I had no phone to use at all. I called Comviq again and it turned out that the support who had reordered the subscription had not ordered a phone. After some calls I got in contact with a nice girl who provided me with compensation for the delays and sent my phone with prioritized delivery, and as of today I have this very cool piece of technology in my hands.
