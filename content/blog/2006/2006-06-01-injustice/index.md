Yesterday a large search engine was shutdown here in Sweden. The shutdown was unexpected because the website provided no illegal material, only links (in form of BitTorrent files) to both free and copyrighted material, which is legal here in Sweden. Behind the scenes are the MPAA and the US government, who convinced the Swedish government to bend our laws to fit Hollywoods likings. The police confiscated the entire server hall, which affected a large number of companies unrelated to the search engine. The whole bust is very strange and is bound to fuel some flamy debates.

It's probably just a matter of time before they force upon us (un)intelligent design teachings in school, and of course prohibit abortion.

But there are some brighter areas in the otherwise cold, dark reality. I finished off a `GObject` this afternoon that hooks up the ALSA sequencer to the GLib `GMainLoop` and fires signals when I poke my Hercules DJ Console. I've played a bit with a small test program that allows me to control two instances of `xmms2d`. Yey for play/pause syncing two playbacks of the same track! :wink:

Task left are:

- Find out what is the best way to find cue points.
- Cache waveform preview.
- BPM analysis.
