Today started way too early. Apparently the janitor assigned to replace the bathroom window thought it was a good idea to drop in unannounced at 7.30 am. I'd got at least 6 hours of sleep so after a cup of coffee the day started.

Twenty minutes of work the builder decided he couldn't finish the work at place so he brought the window with him. An hour later he came back and put the window in place, followed by loud complaints about the bad shape the previous builders had left the windows in.

Yey! After 2 months of transparent windows next to the toilet it was finally back to normal, or so I thought. When I opened the window I noticed that he hadn't actually fixed the glass to the window frame, but left it kind of hanging there, and closing it again proved impossible without a huge amount of violence.

Re-dialed the number and a while later two other janitors came by to clean up the mess of the first one. They stayed the whole afternoon fixing both the window and some other stuff that had been waiting to get fixed for quite some time. When leaving they concluded that they had to come back the next day to finish things up. So out they went, leaving all the garbage where it had landed. Some primal instinct tells me they will not show up tomorrow.

_**Update**_:
It's been about 2.5 weeks now and they still haven't come back. They also tore a 1.5m branch off my hops plant, that was the longest branch by the time, bastards!
