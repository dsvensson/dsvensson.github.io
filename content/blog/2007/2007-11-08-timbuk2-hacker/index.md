Been looking for a new bag for the past months due to my old one having a non-padded laptop compartment, and was above all starting to get pretty worn out after the 7-8 years it had served me. I went to the common stores downtown, I went to Apple store, I browsed the net, I asked people what bags they had, and finally I got a tip from Per at work of a San Francisco based company by the name [Timbuk2][1]. I knew I wanted a vertical messenger bag this time, and that limited my choice to more or less two models, [Blogger][2] or [Hacker][3]. After having read a review at [Laughing Squid][4] I decided to go with the Hacker model.

By now it's filled up with my accessories and I've been using it for the first day. I must say I'm very satisfied, definitely should have bought it months back. The laptop compartment is well padded (woho!) and it's roomy enough for my needs, and of course it looks good too! Without doubt the best bag I've ever had, and I haven't even tried out the backpack mode for real yet, more love ahead I suspect.
