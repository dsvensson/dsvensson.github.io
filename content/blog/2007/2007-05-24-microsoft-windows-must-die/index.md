Today was the last day I booted Windows on my laptop after work. And this is the story:

1. Open up the X-Box.
2. Solder the sweet spots to remove the firmware write protection.
3. Start Mechassault.
4. Load save game and wait for Linux to boot.
5. Launch `cmd.exe`.
6. Start `ftp.exe`.
7. `cd /mnt/C` and `put M8_LBA48_IGR_C-06.bin`.
8. Fire up `telnet` and issue `raincoat -p /mnt/C/M8_LBA48_IGR_C-06.bin`.
9. Reboot.
10. Realize that a modern OS like Windows XP ships crap shit software that uploads files in ASCII-mode by default, instead of binary-mode like the rest of the world.
11. Recommend a modchip to my friend while throwing random adult-only words at Microsoft.
12. Rant on IRC.
13. Write a blog entry.
